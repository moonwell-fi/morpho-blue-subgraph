## Known Issues

### Technical Challenges
1. **Price Feed Timing**: Occasional delays in price feed updates can lead to temporary USD value discrepancies.
   - **Status**: Monitoring, considering implementation of time-weighted averages
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Historical Data Volume**: Markets with long histories accumulate large amounts of snapshot data.
   - **Status**: Evaluating storage optimization strategies
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Complex Queries**: Some queries against large markets can be resource-intensive.
   - **Status**: Working on query optimization techniques
   - **Priority**: High

4. **Rate Calculation Precision**: Edge cases in interest rate calculations can show minor discrepancies.
   - **Status**: Reviewing calculation methodology
   - **Priority**: Low

5. **Event Ordering**: Multiple events in the same transaction can cause ordering effects.
   - **Status**: Implementing deterministic processing order
   - **Priority**: Medium

### Integration Challenges
1. **Cross-Network Aggregation**: No built-in mechanism for cross-network data aggregation.
   - **Status**: Designing API aggregation layer
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Oracle Fallbacks**: Limited fallback mechanisms for price feed outages.
   - **Status**: Designing fallback system
   - **Priority**: High

3. **Schema Evolution**: Managing schema changes without disrupting existing integrations.
   - **Status**: Planning schema versioning approach
   - **Priority**: Low

## Overall Progress

The Morpho Blue subgraph is functionally complete for all core features with active development focused on:

1. **Performance optimization** for scale and efficiency
2. **Enhanced analytics** to provide deeper insights
3. **Improved documentation** for developer accessibility
4. **Robust monitoring** for operational reliability
5. **Advanced testing** for data integrity validation

The subgraph is currently production-ready and actively used for protocol monitoring, analytics dashboards, and application integrations across multiple networks.
