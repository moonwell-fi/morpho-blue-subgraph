# Product Context: Morpho Blue Subgraph

## Why This Project Exists
The Morpho Blue Subgraph exists to solve the challenge of accessing and analyzing blockchain data for the Morpho Blue lending protocol and MetaMorpho vault system. Blockchain data is inherently difficult to query and aggregate in its raw form. This subgraph transforms on-chain events into an organized, indexed, and easily queryable dataset.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Data Accessibility**: Raw blockchain data is difficult to query and analyze without specialized tools.
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: DeFi protocols require continuous monitoring of positions, markets, and risk parameters.
3. **Historical Analysis**: Understanding trends and historical performance requires aggregated time-series data.
4. **Integration Complexity**: Applications that want to display Morpho Blue data would otherwise need complex indexing infrastructure.
5. **Cross-platform Consistency**: Ensures consistent data representation across all applications using Morpho Blue data.
6. **Multi-network Support**: Simplifies the complexity of tracking the protocol across different networks.

## How It Should Work
1. **Event Indexing**: Listen to events emitted by Morpho Blue, MetaMorpho, and related contracts.
2. **Data Transformation**: Process raw events into structured entities with relationships.
3. **State Tracking**: Maintain the current state of markets, positions, and protocol metrics.
4. **Price Feed Integration**: Incorporate price data from oracles for accurate value calculations.
5. **API Exposure**: Provide a GraphQL API for flexible querying of all indexed data.
6. **Real-time Updates**: Synchronize with the blockchain to provide near real-time data.

## User Experience Goals
1. **For Developers**:
   - Simple, intuitive GraphQL schema
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Easy integration with frontend applications
   - Reliable, consistent data

2. **For Data Analysts**:
   - Complete historical data
   - Accurate metrics and calculations
   - Ability to perform complex queries
   - Cross-entity relationships for deep analysis

3. **For Morpho Protocol Team**:
   - Monitoring of protocol health
   - Insights into user behavior
   - Performance metrics for different markets
   - Tools for governance decisions

4. **For End Users** (via applications built on the subgraph):
   - Real-time position information
   - Market performance data
   - Historical APY and utilization rates
   - Risk assessment metrics
