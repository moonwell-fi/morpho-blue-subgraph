# Active Context: Morpho Blue Subgraph

## Current Work Focus

The Morpho Blue subgraph is currently focused on providing comprehensive indexing for the Morpho Blue lending protocol and MetaMorpho vault system across multiple networks. The project is actively maintaining and enhancing the following components:

1. **Multi-Network Support**: The subgraph has implementations for Optimism, Ethereum Mainnet, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Scroll, and several L2/L3 networks like Fraxtal, Ink, Mode, and others.

2. **MetaMorpho Integration**: Full support for MetaMorpho vaults, including tracking vault creation, deposits, withdrawals, and allocation strategies.

3. **Public Allocator Tracking**: Implementation for the Public Allocator system that allows community participation in capital allocation.

4. **Price Feed System**: Integration with Chainlink oracles for accurate price data across all assets.

## Recent Changes

Recent developments in the subgraph include:

1. **Added Support for New Networks**: Implementation of support for emerging L2/L3 networks including Fraxtal, Ink, Mode, Unichain, Sonic, Corn, and Hemi.

2. **MetaMorpho Factory v1.1 Support**: Added handlers for the updated MetaMorpho Factory contract (v1.1), which allows tracking of new vault deployments.

3. **Public Allocator Indexing**: Implemented complete indexing for the PublicAllocator contract, capturing events related to public reallocation, withdrawals, fee settings, and admin changes.

4. **Enhanced Chainlink Oracle Integration**: Improved price feed tracking with support for aggregator confirmations and answer updates.

## Next Steps

The following tasks are planned for upcoming development:

1. **Cross-Network Analytics**: Implement functionality to aggregate protocol data across multiple networks for comprehensive analytics.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Review and optimize indexing performance, particularly for high-transaction-volume markets.

3. **Schema Validation**: Ensure consistent schema implementation across all network deployments.

4. **Extended Testing**: Develop comprehensive testing procedures to validate data consistency and accuracy.

5. **Documentation Updates**: Enhance API documentation with example queries for common use cases.

6. **Monitoring Improvements**: Implement better alerting for indexing issues or anomalies.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

Current technical decisions and considerations include:

1. **Network Expansion Strategy**: Determining priority for adding support for new networks where Morpho Blue is being deployed.

2. **Entity Relationship Optimization**: Evaluating the current entity model for opportunities to optimize query performance.

3. **Interest Rate Calculation Refinement**: Reviewing the precision of interest rate calculations, particularly for markets with low utilization.

4. **Historical Data Management**: Balancing the need for detailed historical data against indexing performance and storage considerations.

5. **Price Feed Fallback Mechanisms**: Implementing robust fallback mechanisms for price feeds to handle oracle outages or delays.

6. **MetaMorpho Capital Efficiency Analysis**: Developing improved metrics for analyzing capital efficiency in MetaMorpho vaults.

## Current Implementation Status

The subgraph currently indexes:

1. **Core Morpho Blue Protocol**:
   - Market creation and configuration
   - Supply/borrow transactions
   - Collateral management
   - Liquidations
   - Interest accrual

2. **MetaMorpho Vaults**:
   - Vault creation via factory contracts
   - Deposit/withdraw operations
   - Vault configuration changes
   - Allocation strategies

3. **Public Allocator**:
   - Public reallocations to markets
   - Withdrawals from markets
   - Fee settings and transfers
   - Administrative changes

4. **Price Data**:
   - Chainlink oracle integrations
   - Price updates and confirmations
   - Currency conversions for USD values

## Known Issues

Current known limitations or issues:

1. **Price Feed Delays**: There can be slight delays in price feed updates, affecting real-time USD value calculations.

2. **Cross-Network Aggregation**: Aggregating data across multiple networks currently requires manual consolidation.

3. **Historical Snapshot Storage**: Very long-running markets may accumulate large amounts of snapshot data, impacting query performance.

4. **Rate Precision**: Some edge cases in interest rate calculations may show minor discrepancies compared to on-chain values.

5. **Event Ordering**: In rare cases of multiple events in the same transaction, the processing order may affect intermediate state calculations.
